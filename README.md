### Issues that we encountered during development
* Rigidity - is the tendency for software to be difficult to change, even in simple ways. Every change causes a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent modules
* Fragility - When you make a change, unexpected parts of the system break.
* Immobility - hard to reuse
* Viscosity - easier to hack than fix properly
* Opacity - Hard to read/understand 


### How do you define “Good Code”?

* Code should be self documenting
* Code should be transparent - easy to understand
* Good code is like a good joke, It needs no explanations


### Design Principles

* Keep it (D.R.Y.) – Don’t repeat yourself!
* K.I.S.S – Keep it simple, St**id!
* Y.A.G.N.I – You aren’t gonna need it!
* S.O.L.I.D


### S.O.L.I.D. Design Principles - Robert Martin 

Books:
* Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices by Robert and Micah Martin.
* Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship

S.O.L.I.D.
* S – Single Responsibility Principle
* O – Open/Close Principle
* L – Liskov Substitution Principle
* I – Interface Segregation Principle
* D – Dependency Inversion Principle


### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

##### Definition:
A class should have only one reason to change

Benefits:
* easier to understand
* easier to maintain
* more reusable

Disadvantages of Long Methods:
* hard to read
* hard to reuse/ leads to duplication
* hard to test
* many reasons to change
